    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed above, Trie is obviously better than unordered list in term of complaxity. We now discussed briefly on Trie and Hash tables.\n",
    "Call N as the number of words in the dataset, M is the length of the word we are considering: \n",
    "\n",
    "### For insert: \n",
    "- Trie: $O(M)$\n",
    "- Hash: $O(h)$ for $h$ is the numbebr of hash functions. There can be collisions, which requires open addressing or separate chaining. \n",
    "\n",
    "### For search: \n",
    "- Trie: $O(M)$\n",
    "- Hash: $O(h)$ for $h$ is the numbebr of hash functions. There can be collisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### For auto-complete and auto-correct:\n",
    "- Trie: available in $O(\\overline{L})$: efficient while the hash table might require more operations for certain features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storage \n",
    "- Hash table: Hash table requires a large storage inorder to efficiently avoid collisions. However, it is still more storage-efficient compared to Trie.\n",
    "- Trie: The main disadvantage of tries is that they need lot of memory for storing the strings. For each node we have too many variables to store (weight, child, follow, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Further discussion: \n",
    "If storage is a concern: we should not implement Trie. The recommendation is Ternary search tree: for such tree: time complexity of search operation is O(h) where h is height of the tree. Ternary Search Trees also supports other operations supported by Trie like prefix search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we can create a customized users input, where users can import their writing and we can scan through the document and readjust the dictionaries for customized users. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I did not include the delete function as I imported data from a dictionary. Hence, deleting a word from a dictionary is not preferred. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Trie offers faster string operation (search, insert, auto correct, auto complete) but requires huge memory to store the strings."
