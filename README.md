# Trie

Trie is a tree data structure often used for words processing. I created a Trie data structure with the vocabulary imported from Urban Dictionary API. 

The Trie I created is capable of: 
- Checking if the word is correct in constant time
- Recommend the most used word given the prefix
- Auto correct the world with at max 2 incorrect letters
